I have been professionally developing software for over 5 years. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Sakarya University.
My primary focus is on back-end software development, although I also work on hobbies and side projects. Recently, I have taken an interest in the following technologies:

* Kafka, NATS
* Mongo, Redis, Elasticsearch, Eventstrore, Apache Flink
* AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Docker, K8S
* Design and develop distributed, event-driven systems using cross-platform programming languages such as C#, Java, Go, Python, and JavaScript

I enjoy working with new technologies, engaging in discussions, implementing new ideas, conducting research, and continuously learning. I am always ready to take on new responsibilities.
